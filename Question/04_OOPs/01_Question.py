# Write a python class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle. The class should have the following functionalities:

# A method named set_dimension that two perameters  width and height and sets the attributes of the rectangle object accordingly.
# A method named area that calculate and return the area of the rectangle
# A method named perimeter that calculate and return the perimeter of the rectangle

# Use theis to create object of the class and print the width, height, area and peremerter.



# height = int(input("Enter the height of the rectangle:  "))
# width = int(input("Enter the width of the rectangle:  "))

# class Rectangle:

#     def set_dimension(self, width, height):
#         self.width = width
#         self.height = height

#     def area(self):
#         area_of_rectanle = self.width * self.height
#         return area_of_rectanle
    
#     def perimeter(self):
#         perimeter_of_rectangle =2 * (self.width + self.height)
#         return perimeter_of_rectangle
    

# rectangle1 = Rectangle()
# rectangle1.set_dimension(height, width)
# print(f"The area of the rectanlge is: {rectangle1.area()}")
# print(f"The perimeter of the rectanlge is: {rectangle1.perimeter()}")
