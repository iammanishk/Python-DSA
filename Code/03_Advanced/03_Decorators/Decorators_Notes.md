# Decorators
- Decorators are a powerful and flexible feature that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without changing their actual implementation. Decorators provide a way to add functionality to existing functions or methods in a clean and reusable manner.

### Use Cases for Decorators:
- Logging: 
     Decorators can be used to add logging functionality to functions, allowing you to track function calls and their parameters.
- Authorization:
     Decorators can be used to restrict access to certain functions based on user permissions or roles.
- Caching:
     Decorators can be used to cache the results of expensive function calls, improving performance by avoiding redundant computations.
- Validation:
     Decorators can be used to validate function arguments or return values, ensuring that they meet certain criteria.
