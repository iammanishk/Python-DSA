# NOTES OF THE BASICS 

## ```print``` is used for print any things
```
print("Jay Shree Ram")
```

## ```Variables``` are just like container that stores something like **data**, and container in the sense *memory*.

```
x = 5
y = -1
name = "Manish"
login = "true"
```

### And data could be anything
- It could be Integers
- It couold be String
- It could be Number and many more

**Naming Rule For Vailable**
- A variable name must start with a letter or with underscore
- A variable name cannot start with number
- A variable name can only start with Alphanumberic and Underscore (A-z,0-9 and _)
- A variabe name case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are different)
- A variable name cannot be any Python *keyword*

> In Python there are some reserved word which is called *Keyword*

## ```DataTypes``` are classifications that specify which type of value a variable can hold.The interpreter uses these *datatypes* to understand how to manipulate and store data in the memory.

### 1. int : Integers datatype represent the whole numbers (eg. 8, -48)
### 2. float : Floating-point datatype represent the decimal number (eg. 3.58, -4.85)
